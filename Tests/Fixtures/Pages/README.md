# Page photos

Six frames of the SmartDoc 2015 Challenge 1 dataset for the corner model's tests: one from each of
background01 to background04 and two from background05, the cluttered desk where our own page search does
worst (a cable across the page, more sheets under it, pens on it). Read by the Swift model tests
(`Tests/CompleteScannerModelTests`, found next to the test file) and copied next to the C# test assembly
by `windows/LazyScan.App.Tests`.

The frames are 1920 × 1080 in the dataset. Here they are scaled to 1280 × 720 (Lanczos) and saved as
JPEG at quality 90, and their ground-truth corners scaled by the same 2/3. `corners.json` lists each file
with its size and the page's corners in its pixels, as the dataset names them: by the page's own top, so
in `background04-tax004-0125.jpg`, whose page lies on its side, `topLeft` is the corner at the lower
left. Compare them by position (`Quad.fromCorners`).

would on photos they have never seen.
